### Project-Omega

##### I developed a Todo List application inspired by an online tutorial titled "Building a Todo List App or Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." The tutorial provided a comprehensive guide to creating such a tool. In this application, adding tasks to your list is a breeze. Simply type the task into the input box, click the "Add" button, and voila! Your task is added to the list. A notable feature is the ability to toggle task completion status by clicking the task name. A close icon has also been implemented to enable task deletion directly from the Todo list. Crucially, the tutorial introduced the concept of Local Storage in JavaScript, allowing the task list to persist even after closing and reopening the browser. This ensures that users can access their saved Todo list seamlessly across sessions.
